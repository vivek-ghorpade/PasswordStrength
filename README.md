# PasswordStrength

A Python program that assesses the strength of a password based on several criteria:

Length of the password
Presence of uppercase letters
Presence of lowercase letters
Presence of numbers
Presence of special characters
The tool provides feedback on the password's strength



Explanation of the Code:

Regex Pattern Matching:

We use regular expressions (re.search) to check the presence of specific types of characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, special characters).
For instance, re.search(r'[A-Z]', password) checks if the password contains at least one uppercase letter.

Feedback and Scoring:

The password is scored based on its compliance with each requirement (length, character types, etc.). Each fulfilled requirement increases the score.
The strength of the password is categorized as "Very Weak", "Weak", "Medium", "Strong", or "Very Strong" based on the total score.

Feedback Messages:

If a password fails to meet a certain requirement, a corresponding suggestion is added to the feedback list.
If all requirements are met, the program outputs "Your password is strong!"

User Interaction:

The program continuously asks for a password and displays feedback until the user enters 'q' to quit.




How It Works:

The program asks the user to input a password.

It checks the password's length and whether it contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
Based on the checks, it assigns a strength rating to the password and provides feedback to help improve the password's strength.




Password Strength Ratings:

Very Weak: Password meets very few or none of the criteria.

Weak: Password meets 1-2 criteria.

Medium: Password meets 3 criteria.

Strong: Password meets 4 criteria.

Very Strong: Password meets all 5 criteria.




Features for Enhancement:

Password Length: You could increase the minimum length requirement for even stronger passwords.

Complexity Feedback: Add more detailed feedback for users, such as advising on mixed cases, better special characters, or avoidance of dictionary words.

Entropy Calculation: You could calculate the "entropy" of the password to provide a more sophisticated strength assessment based on randomness.


This simple tool can help users improve the quality and security of their passwords!
